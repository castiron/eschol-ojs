How to clean out the OJS database, in preparation for first import:

First, this script will wipe the database and run the OJS install tool:

  cd /apps/subi/apache/htdocs/ojs/eschol/utilities
  ./initdb.sh

Then this will import the very few customizations that are in the database
(as opposed to in the schema files used by the installer, or php files):

  gomysql < ./dev_cust.sql
