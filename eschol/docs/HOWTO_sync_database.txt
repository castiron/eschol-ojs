How to blow away the OJS database (and files) on dev, and replace them
with the database (and files) from prod:

1. First, back up the production database to Mercurial. 

   NOTE: this no longer backs up files since they're so big as to be
   unmanageable in Mercurial. It only backs up the db.

   a. Log in to the 'subi' role on submit prod.
   b. cd ~/apache/htdocs/ojs/eschol/utilities
   c. ./backup.sh
      (this dumps the database to ~/ojs/db_backup, then checks in the
      dump and public/ files in ~/ojs to Mercurial.)

2. Clean dev
   a. Log in to the 'subi' role on submit-dev
   b. monit stop apache
   c. find ~/apache/htdocs/ojs/cache -name '*.php' | xargs rm		# this clears the OJS cache

3. Update dev from prod
   a. cd ~
   b. rsync -av --delete submit.escholarship.org:ojs/ ojs/
      (This will make the dev ~/ojs directory exactly equal to the prod directory,
       including the .hg directory for Mercurial.
       It will blow away any extraneous files and directories, so if you want any of 
       these be sure to move them elsewhere.)
   d. gomysql < ojs/db_backup/ojs_db_dump.sql     # this recreates all tables
   e. monit start apache
   f. (now test)
