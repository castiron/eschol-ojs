Since these journal-specific logo files and css need to be directly web-
accessible, OJS requires them to be somewhere in the apache directory 
structure, as opposed to uploaded documents and other files which are mediated 
by OJS and thus can (and should) be somewhere not web-accessible.

So what I did is move ~/apache/ojs/public/journals to ~/ojs/public/journals, 
and left behind a symlink for Apache to follow. This way they're alongside the 
rest of the files that are stored in ~/ojs/files and thus become part of the 
Mercurial-tracked files, and thus become part of the transfer when we sync dev.

Does that make sense? I know it's confusing with the two ojs directories. Think 
of ~/apache/htdocs/ojs as the OJS code, and ~/ojs as the user files. This 
change takes some user files that were breaking that rule and puts them where 
they belong.
