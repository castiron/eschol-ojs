OJS Javascript use
==================

Here's some code to detect jQuery version: 
        jQuery.fn.jquery

Here's some code to detect jQuery UI version: 
        jQuery.ui.version

Our custom role add check:
        On ojs/index.php/journalName/manager/createUser at least, probably some other pages too.
        When you type the email of an existing user, it offers to add role instead of creating a new user.
        Very, very minimal use of jQuery.
        Still works.
        ==> Done.

js/articleView.js
        #sidebarToggle and #fullscreenShow
        Only used on 'article' page, which in turn appears to be part of OJS front-end

js/pdfobject.js
        Only used on 'article' page

"throbber"
        #citationEditorExportPane
        used in templates/copyeditor/submissionCitations.tpl, templates/sectionEditor/submissionCitations.tpl, templates/citation/citationEditor.tpl
        The citation editor is enabled by a journal-wide setting, 'metaCitations'
        but all our journals have "metaCitations" turned off.

lib/pkp/js/ajax_upload.js
        It appears to be referenced in lib/pkp/classes/template/PKPTemplateManager.inc.php but nowhere else. I think we're not using this.

lib/pkp/js/fontController.js
        Seems to be working properly.

lib/pkp/js/general.js
        Seems to be working. Makes very light use of JQuery

lib/pkp/js/grid-clickhandler.js 
        a little click handler. Refers to css ".row_controls"
        That's used in PKPCitationGridRow and PKPFilterGridRow
        We know citation grid isn't used in our OJS (see above).
        What is PKPFilterGridRow? Used from PKPFilterGridHandler. What's that? Called from FilterGridHandler.
        What's that? Subclassed as grid.filter.ParserFilterGridHandler and grid.filter.LookupFilterGridHandler among others.
        Where are those used? classes/manager/form/setup/JournalSetupStep3Form.inc.php
        Ah. Instances are placed in variables parserFilterGridUrl and lookupFilterGridUrl.
        Used in templates/manager/setup/step3.tpl.
        They're only used if citations are enabled. Whew.

lib/pkp/js/jquery.cookie.js
        Used by fontController.js.
        And fontController's cookies appear to be working fine.
        So good.

lib/pkp/js/jquery.pnotify.js
        Used in lib/pkp/templates/common/footer.tpl
        Displays "systemNotifications" in a loop using pnotify
        What are system notifications? Assigned in lib/pkp/classes/template/PKPTemplateManager.inc.php
        $notifications =& $notificationDao->getNotificationsByUserId($user->getId(), NOTIFICATION_LEVEL_TRIVIAL);
        To get this to trigger, I didn't figure out how to make a notification happen in the UI. Instead I inserted it
        into the database:  insert into notifications values(null, 1, 1, '2014-09-17 15:19:46', null, null, 'notification.type.galleyModified', 'LEED-ND and Livability Revisited', 'https://submit-dev.escholarship.org/ojs/index.php/ucb_crp_bpj/layoutEditor/submissionEditing/20808#layout', 1, 'ojs2', 49, 16777222);
        Then I got a notification box in the upper-right corner when I was logged in as the right user and on the right journal's page.
        It had an "X" close box, and faded out in a javascript-y way, so I think it works.

lib/pkp/js/jquery.tablednd_0_5.js
        Called by lib/pkp/js/tablednd.js, which is included in lots of pages.
        Wow, who knew you could rearrange tables (e.g. the back issues) using drag-n-drop.
        Works with the new jQuery, so yay.

lib/pkp/js/jqueryValidatorI18n.js
        Seems to localize "jquery validation plugin" (below perhaps), but I think we don't care.

lib/pkp/js/lib/jquery/jquery.min.js
        I think this does not get used at all. Removed to be totally sure, since we need the upgraded version.

lib/pkp/js/lib/jquery/plugins/jquery.form.js
        Only used by ajax_upload, which I verified above we don't use.

lib/pkp/js/lib/jquery/plugins/jqueryUi.min.js
        I think this also does not get used. Removed to be totally sure, since we need the upgraded version.

lib/pkp/js/lib/jquery/plugins/validate/additional-methods.js
        Adds a bunch of functions to jquery.validator (below)

lib/pkp/js/lib/jquery/plugins/validate/jquery.validate.js
        not used (but min is below)
lib/pkp/js/lib/jquery/plugins/validate/jquery.validate.min.js
        included by classes/manager/form/setup/JournalSetupStep3Form.inc.php and lib/pkp/classes/submission/common/PKPAction.inc.php
        As for the former (J Setup Step 3) that's suspicious. I suspect validation is only used on the citation widget, which we don't use.
        And as for the latter (PKPAction): it's the same! Only the citation widget.
        Result ==> Ignore

lib/pkp/js/lib/superfish/hoverIntent.js
lib/pkp/js/lib/superfish/jquery.bgiframe.min.js
lib/pkp/js/lib/superfish/superfish.js
lib/pkp/js/lib/superfish/supersubs.js
lib/pkp/js/superfish/hoverIntent.js
lib/pkp/js/superfish/jquery.bgiframe.min.js
lib/pkp/js/superfish/superfish.js
lib/pkp/js/superfish/supersubs.js
        superfish css seems to be referenced, but I can't find any reference to superfish outside the plugin itself.
        same with bgiframe, hoverIntent, and supersubs.
        So: ignoring.

lib/pkp/js/lib/wufoo/wufoo.js
        I see wufoo.css referenced, but nobody seems to refer to wufoo.js.
        Ignoring.

lib/pkp/js/listbuilder.js
        lib/pkp/classes/controllers/listbuilder/ListbuilderGridRow.inc.php
        lib/pkp/classes/controllers/listbuilder/ListbuilderHandler.inc.php
        lib/pkp/templates/controllers/listbuilder/listbuilder.tpl
        lib/pkp/templates/controllers/listbuilder/listbuilderGrid.tpl
        lib/pkp/templates/controllers/listbuilder/listbuilderItem.tpl

        ListBuilderHandler seems to lead to all the other things, but nothing leads to ListBuilderHandler.
        Strange.
        So, uneasily, deciding to ignore.

lib/pkp/js/modal.js
        This one is a real mixed bag. It appears to be a concatenation of several plugins. Considering each one:

        modal() and modalConfirm()
                registered as smartyModal and smartyModalConfirm. Apparently these can be called from templates like this:
                {modal url=$dialogUrl actOnId="#gridName" button="#dialogButton"}
                so, where does it do that?
                only in lib/pkp/templates/linkAction/linkAction.tpl
                and only if if $action->getMode() eq $smarty.const.LINK_ACTION_MODE_MODAL or MODAL_CONFIRM
                Those constants in turn are used only in PKPFilterGridHandler.inc.php and PKPFilterGridRow.inc.php,
                which above we determined are only used by citation editor, which we don't use.
                So, not used.
        submitJsonForm
                only used in citationForm.tpl
                skip
        modalAlert
                only used in listbuilder.js
                we're ignoring that, => ignoring this too
        changeModalFormLocale
        clearFormFields
        saveAndUpdate
                not used anywhere
        ajaxAction
                used on linkaction, and also filterForm.tpl, and a bunch of citation forms.
                the only one we haven't eliminated is filterForm, so:
                That's used in FilterGridHandler, which is again citation-specific.
                ==> ignore
        actionThrobber
        extrasOnDemand
        scrollToMakeVisible
        selectRange
                only used in citation stuff
                ==> ignore
        updateItem
        deleteElementById
                only used within modal.js itself
                ==> ignore
        $.browser
                used by jquery.validate, superfish, article.tpl, and citationEditor.tpl
                all are not used in our OJS
                ==> ignore
        $.hotkeys
                Not sure but it seems likely to be citation related.
                ==> ignore

lib/pkp/js/tablednd.js
        see lib/pkp/js/jquery.tablednd_0_5.js
        It's working so far.

lib/pkp/js/tag-it.js
        Used in lib/pkp/templates/common/header.tpl which means it's everywhere.
        The function appears to be used lots of places:
                lib/pkp/templates/form/keywordInput.tpl
                templates/manager/people/userProfileForm.tpl
                templates/sectionEditor/createReviewerForm.tpl
                etc.
        Let's look at userProfileForm. ... $("#interests").tagit({ ...
        Okay, it does javascripty auto-completion stuff. Seems to work, including save.
        ==> Works.

lib/pkp/js/wufoo/wufoo.js
        ==> same as wufoo above, ignore.
